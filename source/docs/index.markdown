### Sky Documentation

The Sky database is simple at heart but it can be daunting to get started.
This documentation is meant to get you up and running quickly and let you dive into behavioral analytics immediately.

First you can start with the installation instructions, then move on to API integration and finally you'll understand how Sky lets you use Lua to provide flexibility when analyzing your data.
In no time you'll see how you can load up data and build funnel analysis queries or ad-hoc cohort analysis.
