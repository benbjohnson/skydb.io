### What is Sky?

Sky is an open source database used for flexible, high performance analysis of [behavioral data](/blog/introduction-to-behavioral-databases.html).
For certain kinds of data such as clickstream data and log data, it can be several orders of magnitude faster than traditional approaches such as SQL databases or Hadoop.

The performance of Sky comes from optimized data organization, fast query execution, and the [embarrassingly parallel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel) nature of behavioral data.
On commodity hardware you can expect to query *several million events per core per second*.
