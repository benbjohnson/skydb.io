### What's New?

To say that Sky v0.3.0 is an upgrade is an understatement.
About 95% of the codebase has been converted to [Go](http://golang.org/) and the API to the database is now RESTful JSON over HTTP.
Look through [The Guide](/guide) and the [Sky README](https://github.com/skydb/sky) on GitHub for more details.

During this rewrite, I took the opportunity to simplify the structure of the database.
The underlying format is just straight MessagePack so it's easy to work with.
There's also no longer a concept of an action.
The database stores partially transient hashes (e.g. hashes where some properties persist their values over time and others don't).
Check out [the guide](/guide) for more details about it.


### What's Next

[Sky v0.3.1](https://github.com/skydb/sky/issues?milestone=8) is the next version and will include distributed computing so you can run Sky across multiple nodes and scale linearly.
It will also include a few additional features such as sampling, query bookmarking and reverse timeline queries.
