### What's New?

Sky version 0.2.1 has been released.
You can download it from the main [Sky web site](/).
There are a lot of features that make data analysis easier:

* The Lua API has been simplified so you just have to implement an `aggregate()` method instead of a `map()` and `reduce()` method.
  You can see examples of this througout the [docs](/docs).
  
* Session support has been added!
  Now you can demarcate sessions by idle time so you can do event analysis in the context of a session.
  You can read about it on the [Aggregating Sessions](/docs/session.html) page.
  
* The [Bandicoot](https://github.com/benbjohnson/bandicoot) crash reporting library has been added to the server.
  If you experience crashes with Sky then please copy and paste the crash report and [submit a ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/skydb/sky/issues).

* Added a `SkyDB.ping()` method to the Ruby API to check whether the server is up and running. (Thanks [@emiddleton](https://github.com/emiddleton)!)


### What's Next

Starting in mid-January I'll be leaving my job to start a company called Skyland Labs that is devoted to the development of Sky.
Expect to see a lot more activity on the project going forward.
2013 will be an exciting year for Sky.
