### What's New?

Sky version 0.2.3 has been released.
You can download it from the main [Sky web site](/).
We've added a command line importer, overhauled the query system and fixed a bunch of bugs!

Major changes:

* A new query interface has been added!
  The Lua API is still in the server but the preferred way to query for data is using the new ActiveRecord-style query interface in the Ruby gem.
  Check out the [Behavioral Query Language](/docs/query.html) docs for more information.
  
* A flexible command line data importer has been added.
  It can load CSV and tab-delimited formats into the database using a simple transform definition.
  JSON and server log formats will be added in the near future.
  You can find out more about how to use it by looking at the [Bulk Importing Data](/docs/import.html) docs.
  

### What's Next

The next version of Sky will include additional query and importer features.
Also expect to see the Sky front-end called **Skybox** being released in the near future.
It'll give you the ability to explore the behavior of your users with an easy to use web-based interface.
