&lt;p&gt;Sky version 0.2.2 has been released.
You can download it from the main &lt;a href="/"&gt;Sky web site&lt;/a&gt;.
We&amp;#39;ve added a command line importer, overhauled the query system and fixed a bunch of bugs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new query interface has been added!
The Lua API is still in the server but the preferred way to query for data is using the new ActiveRecord-style query interface in the Ruby gem.
Check out the &lt;a href="/docs/query.html"&gt;Behavioral Query Language&lt;/a&gt; docs for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flexible command line data importer has been added.
It can load CSV and tab-delimited formats into the database using a simple transform definition.
JSON and server log formats will be added in the near future.
You can find out more about how to use it by looking at the &lt;a href="/docs/import.html"&gt;Bulk Importing Data&lt;/a&gt; docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s Next&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next version of Sky will include additional query and importer features.
Also expect to see the Sky front-end called &lt;strong&gt;Skybox&lt;/strong&gt; being released in the near future.
It&amp;#39;ll give you the ability to explore the behavior of your users with an easy to use web-based interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sky version 0.2.1 has been released.
You can download it from the main &lt;a href="/"&gt;Sky web site&lt;/a&gt;.
There are a lot of features that make data analysis easier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Lua API has been simplified so you just have to implement an &lt;code&gt;aggregate()&lt;/code&gt; method instead of a &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reduce()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/li&gt;

You can see examples of this througout the &lt;a href="/docs"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Session support has been added!
Now you can demarcate sessions by idle time so you can do event analysis in the context of a session.
You can read about it on the &lt;a href="/docs/session.html"&gt;Aggregating Sessions&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/bandicoot"&gt;Bandicoot&lt;/a&gt; crash reporting library has been added to the server.
If you experience crashes with Sky then please copy and paste the crash report and &lt;a href="https://github.com/skydb/sky/issues"&gt;submit a ticket on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added a &lt;code&gt;SkyDB.ping()&lt;/code&gt; method to the Ruby API to check whether the server is up and running. (Thanks &lt;a href="https://github.com/emiddleton"&gt;@emiddleton&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s Next&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in mid-January I&amp;#39;ll be leaving my job to start a company called Skyland Labs that is devoted to the development of Sky.
Expect to see a lot more activity on the project going forward.
2013 will be an exciting year for Sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sky version 0.2.0 has been released.
You can download it from the main &lt;a href="/"&gt;Sky web site&lt;/a&gt;.
A lot has gone into this release but there are a few areas that are especially important:&lt;/p&gt;

A lot has gone into this release but there are a few areas that are especially important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://luajit.org/"&gt;LuaJIT&lt;/a&gt; has been integrated so you can now run map/reduce across your data on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/"&gt;LevelDB&lt;/a&gt; replaced the previous data store.
LevelDB is a solid key-value store that was written by the famous Googlers, Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat.
I originally wrote Sky with a custom in-memory data store for performance.
However, after some testing with LevelDB I found that the performance cost could be amortized and Sky is still crunching tens of millions of events per second per core.
Not too shabby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sky now compiles without warnings on Ubuntu &amp;amp; GCC.
I&amp;#39;m also working on testing other Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stability was a big focus with this release as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s Next&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next month I&amp;#39;ll be working on an analytics front-end called Skybox.
You can watch the &lt;a href="https://github.com/skydb/skybox"&gt;repository on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; if you want to follow along.
Skybox will be a Sinatra application that gives you a framework for working with behavioral data analysis.
It will have some built-in visualizations but also let you easily extend it for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out if you&amp;#39;re interested in seeing some advanced &lt;a href="http://d3js.org/"&gt;D3.js&lt;/a&gt; visualization or if you have some behavioral data you want to crunch and understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect a Sky v0.3.0 release soon after that as well.
Skybox will be integrating some machine learning and predictive analytics so I&amp;#39;ll be adding other workflows and pipelining to the Lua processing besides map/reduce.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Project Status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sky has come a long way this past year: It saw its first official v0.1.0
release. A custom query language called Qip was written for it (and then
removed). And finally, multicore distribution was added to allow linear
scalability on each core.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Project Status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sky has come a long way this past year: It saw its first official v0.1.0
release. A custom query language called Qip was written for it (and then
removed). And finally, multicore distribution was added to allow linear
scalability on each core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that begs the question, what’s next for Sky?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Rest of the Year&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sky is still an early project so I’m not making projections too far out.
However, there are still some awesome features coming down the pipe for
the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Sky will be adding Lua support via the &lt;a href="http://luajit.org/"&gt;LuaJIT&lt;/a&gt; project. LuaJIT
is an awesome project that allows for dynamic scripting that is compiled
down to machine code at runtime. It’s widely recognized as one of the
fastest dynamic languages available and allows for direct interface with
C code and data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I’m going to be starting an open source analytics project using
Rails that is backed by Sky. You can think of it as an open source
version of &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://mixpanel.com/"&gt;MixPanel&lt;/a&gt;. Those are both awesome
products but unfortunately you give up a lot of flexibility and
ownership of your data when you use them. There are some open source
tools available such as &lt;a href="http://piwik.org/"&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt; but they only provide basic hit
counters for your pages. With the speed and flexibility of Sky, I
believe you can do powerful analytics like funnel analysis, cohort
analysis and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear some suggestions as to what other features you’d like
to see in Sky or the new Sky analytics tool. There are also tentative
plans for &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/"&gt;V8&lt;/a&gt; to query using JavaScript and &lt;a href="http://julialang.org/"&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt; to query using
statistical computing. Feel free to add a comment below or e-mail the
mailing list at &lt;a href="mailto:sky@librelist.com"&gt;sky@librelist.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#39;m releasing code and a video for the first &lt;a href="/"&gt;Sky&lt;/a&gt; demo app.
Sky is built to aggregate user actions and state over time so I wanted to find a data set and a visualization that fellow developers would relate to.
And so was born: &lt;strong&gt;The GitHub Archive Visualizer!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#39;m releasing code and a video for the first &lt;a href="/"&gt;Sky&lt;/a&gt; demo app.
Sky is built to aggregate user actions and state over time so I wanted to find a data set and a visualization that fellow developers would relate to.
And so was born: &lt;strong&gt;The GitHub Archive Visualizer!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="span4"&gt;
    The visualizer uses Sky to step through aggregate paths of user actions.
    So you can walk through and see what users do immediately following an action such as &lt;code&gt;Create Repository&lt;/code&gt;.
    The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram"&gt;Sankey diagram&lt;/a&gt; shows the total number of users who performed each particular path.
    It&amp;rsquo;s also interactive so you can drill down to as many levels deep as you want.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;div class="span4" style="margin:10px 0px"&gt;
    &lt;a class="thumbnail" href="/images/github-archive-visualizer/githubarchiveviz.png"&gt;
      &lt;img src="/images/github-archive-visualizer/githubarchiveviz_thumb.png"&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to note that all the results are computed in real-time.
There&amp;#39;s no aggregation happening.
Every click on the UI recomputes the entire dataset.
In the demo, Sky maxes out at about &lt;strong&gt;60MM events per second&lt;/strong&gt;.
That&amp;#39;s fast enough to crunch through the &lt;a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/3/stack-overflow-architecture-update-now-at-95-million-page-vi.html"&gt;monthly pages views of StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; in about a second and a half.
On my laptop.
On a single thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Video Walkthrough&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sky is built to import a lot of events per second but to only allow a handful of large queries at a time.
That&amp;#39;s typically how analytics are used within organizations.
The downside of this is that putting a public demo up and having tens of thousands of people querying tens of millions of events each is just not feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I created a short walkthrough of the demo app that you can view below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="row" style="margin:18px 0"&gt;
  &lt;div class="span6 offset1"&gt;
    &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/51629936"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/github-archive-visualizer/video_thumb.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video is six and a half minutes but the first half is a short history on Sky and some information on the dataset.
If you don&amp;#39;t have time to spare, you can skip to 3:20 to actually see the visualizer in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Installing the Demo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the video does satisfy you need for data crunching, you can install the app locally on your machine.
The &lt;a href="https://github.com/skydb/sky-d3-demo"&gt;sky-d3-demo project&lt;/a&gt; project on GitHub has details on how to get up and running.
If you have any issues getting it installed, feel free to add an &lt;a href="https://github.com/skydb/sky-d3-demo/issues"&gt;issue on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be adding more demos in the future.
If you have any suggestions for behavioral analytics you&amp;#39;d like to see (like &lt;em&gt;dynamic cohort analysis&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;predictive behavioral analytics&lt;/em&gt;), add a comment below to suggest it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Special Thanks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demo wouldn&amp;#39;t be possible without these awesome tools and services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.githubarchive.org/"&gt;The GitHub Archive&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.igvita.com/"&gt;Ilya Grigorik&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;A Short History&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started writing Sky I wanted to make a language that was as fast as C but was dynamic and integrated into the data model.

    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;A Short History&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started writing Sky I wanted to make a language that was as fast as C but was dynamic and integrated into the data model.
So at the beginning of May 2012, I started writing a language called EQL (Event Query Language).
As it turns out, there&amp;#39;s already a language with this name so the name was changed to Qip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After five months of development, Qip turned out to be pretty awesome.
By using LLVM it was as fast as C.
It used metadata to dynamically generate things like MessagePack serialization methods for classes.
And it integrated into Sky pretty nicely by binding structs directly to the underlying data file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But last week I realized that I had to take Qip out of the first release of Sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Too Much, Too Soon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things made me realize that Qip need to be removed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80% of behavioral analysis can be rolled into prebuilt, parameterized functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early releases need to focus on stability, not flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavioral analysis typically centers around understanding what someone is going to do next, how their actions flow over time and segmentation.
People do this with DAGs, Sankey diagrams, cohort analysis, etc.
These types of analysis are relatively easy to understand and don&amp;#39;t require a new language to compute.
These generic features are being built directly in Sky as parameterized functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem with Qip is complexity.
Building a database from scratch is complex enough &amp;ndash; you don&amp;#39;t need to add anymore.
Especially not for the initial release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Future of Qip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qip is not dead.
It&amp;#39;s just in an indefinite slumber.
Once Sky stabilizes more and the module API gets fleshed out then I will reconsider integrating it.
Qip is not the only option on the table though.
Google&amp;#39;s V8 JavaScript engine could integrate well and Lua could be used instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for now, Sky is moving forward with a simpler API and no Qip.&lt;/p&gt;
